## 🎨 Form Pattern (Now Standard Across All Pages)

```tsx
// 1. Define Zod schema
const formSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Name is required'),
  // ... other fields
})

// 2. Use react-hook-form
const form = useForm<FormValues>({
  resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
  defaultValues: { /* ... */ }
})

// 3. Use shadcn Form components
<Form {...form}>
  <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
    <FormField
      control={form.control}
      name="fieldName"
      render={({ field }) => (
        <FormItem>
          <FormLabel>Label *</FormLabel>
          <FormControl>
            <Input {...field} />
          </FormControl>
          <FormMessage />
        </FormItem>
      )}
    />
    
    {/* Buttons */}
    <Button type="submit" disabled={form.formState.isSubmitting}>
      {form.formState.isSubmitting ? 'Saving...' : 'Create'}
    </Button>
  </form>
</Form>
```
