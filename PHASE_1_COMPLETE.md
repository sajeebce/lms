## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Models (12 total)
1. **Tenant** - Multi-tenancy root
2. **User** - RBAC (ADMIN, TEACHER, STUDENT)
3. **Branch** - School locations (status: ACTIVE/INACTIVE)
4. **AcademicYear** - Academic sessions (state: PLANNED/IN_SESSION/COMPLETED/ARCHIVED)
5. **Stream** - Academic departments (Science, Commerce, Arts)
6. **Class** - Grade levels (order field for promotions)
7. **Cohort** - Year + Class + Branch combinations (status, enrollmentOpen)

AcademicYear ‚Üí Cohorts
Stream ‚Üí Classes
Class ‚Üí Cohorts, SectionTemplates
Cohort ‚Üí Sections
Section ‚Üí Routines

## üîí Security & RBAC

### Role-Based Access Control
- All server actions check `requireRole('ADMIN')`
- All queries scoped by `tenantId`
- Mock auth in `lib/auth.ts` (to be replaced with real auth)

### Tenant Isolation
Every query includes `where: { tenantId }` to ensure data isolation.
