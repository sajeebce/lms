## 🎯 Task 1: Remove Cancel Buttons ✅

### Objective
Remove cancel button from all pages, keep only submit button for cleaner UI.

### Completed
- ✅ Classes page
- ✅ Cohorts page
- ✅ Sections page

## 🎯 Task 2: Verify Code Field ✅

### Objective
Analyze if "code" field in Academic Years should be mandatory.

### Analysis
- ✅ Code field is necessary for system integration
- ✅ Serves as unique identifier (e.g., "AY-25-26")
- ✅ Used in reports, exports, and API references
- ✅ Already properly validated with Zod
- ✅ Correctly implemented as mandatory

### Result
NO CHANGES NEEDED - Field is correctly implemented.

---

## 🎯 Task 3: Unlimited Capacity Logic ✅

### Objective
Implement logic where capacity = 0 means unlimited (for online courses).

### Completed
- ✅ Section Templates page
- ✅ Sections page

### Changes Made
1. **Zod Schema:** Changed `min(1)` to `min(0)`
2. **Form Field:** Input now accepts 0, description updated

### Result
Supports both physical classes (limited capacity) and online courses (unlimited capacity).
