## 🎯 Key Implementation Details

### Cancel Button Removal
```typescript
// Before: Had Cancel button
<div className="flex justify-end gap-2 pt-4">
  <Button type="button" variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
  <Button type="submit">Create</Button>
</div>

// After: Only Submit button
<div className="flex justify-end pt-4">
  <Button type="submit">Create</Button>
</div>
```

### Unlimited Capacity Logic
```typescript
// Zod Schema
capacity: z.number().min(0, 'Capacity must be 0 or greater')

// Form Field
<Input type="number" min="0" />

// Display
{capacity === 0 ? '∞ Unlimited' : `${capacity} students`}
```
